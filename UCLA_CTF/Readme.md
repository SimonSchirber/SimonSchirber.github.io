## CTF Challenge Website

This is for 209as Iot Security CTF challenge final project. The goal was to create a CTF challenge that could teach highschoolers about cybersecurity.

The website includes solution videos, point values and categories for each question. It should be noted that an experienced coder could find the answers fairly easily if the know HTML, but the purpose was for learning and youtube solutions are available for every question.

The website for the CTF can be found at [http://ctfucla.online/](http://ctfucla.online/)
